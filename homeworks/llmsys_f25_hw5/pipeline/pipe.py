    An example of the generated schedule for m=3 and n=3 is as follows:
    
    k (i,j) (i,j) (i,j)
    - ----- ----- -----
    0 (0,0)
    1 (1,0) (0,1)

    where k is the clock number, i is the index of micro-batch, and j is the index of partition.

    Each schedule is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains the index of micro-batch and the index of partition.
    This function should yield schedules for each clock cycle.
